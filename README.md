## Introduction
Text summarization is an essential natural language processing (NLP) task that aims to condense a piece of text while retaining its key information. This project utilizes the NLTK and SpaCy libraries to perform text summarization and provides a user-friendly GUI application for easy interaction.

## Features
- Text summarization using extractive techniques
- Support for summarizing both short and long texts
- Graphical user interface for inputting and displaying the summarized text
- Simple and intuitive design for easy navigation and interaction

## Requirements
To run this project, you will need the following dependencies:
- Python 3.x
- NLTK
- SpaCy

## Differences between SpaCy and NLTK

- **NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit):**
- NLTK provides a wide range of tools and resources for natural language processing tasks.
- It offers various algorithms and techniques for text summarization, including extractive summarization approaches.
- NLTK's summarization module includes methods like frequency-based scoring, TF-IDF scoring, and more.
- It is highly customizable, allowing developers to fine-tune the summarization process according to their specific needs.
- NLTK is widely used for educational and research purposes and provides extensive documentation and tutorials.

- **SpaCy:**
- SpaCy is a modern and efficient library for natural language processing tasks.
- It focuses on providing fast and production-ready components for text processing, including tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, and named entity recognition.
- SpaCy does not have a specific module dedicated to text summarization like NLTK.
- However, it can be used in conjunction with other techniques or models to perform summarization tasks.
- SpaCy's strengths lie in its speed and efficiency, making it suitable for large-scale applications and real-time processing.

Both NLTK and SpaCy have their own strengths and weaknesses, and the choice between them depends on the specific requirements of your project and the level of customization and performance you need.

You will also need to download the necessary NLTK and SpaCy language models.
